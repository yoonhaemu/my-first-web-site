    <h2>Kamen Rider begin</h2>
    <p><img src="spiderman.jpg" width="100%"> The franchise began in 1971 with <strong>the <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider" target="_blank" title="가면라이더 위키백과">Kamen Rider</a></u> television series</strong>, which followed college student Takeshi Hongo and his quest to defeat the world-conquering Shocker organization. The original series spawned television and film sequels and launched the Second Kaiju Boom (also known as the Henshin Boom) on Japanese television during the early 1970s, impacting the superhero and action-adventure genres in Japan.</p><p style="margin-top:40px"><h3>Series overview</h3>The Kamen Rider franchise primarily revolving around the eponymous Kamen Rider, a superpowered vigilante who mostly resembles a grasshopper and rides a motorcycle, and their one-man war against an ever-larger malevolent force, usually a terrorist organization bent on world domination. A common running theme in the franchise is that the Rider's power derived from the same source and technology used by malevolent forces, thus forming a moral vow for the protagonists to use this power to fight against evil.<br>Similar to its counterpart, each series focuses on a different Rider, a new set of characters and a different story set in its own universe, though there been multiple instances of past characters from previous Kamen Rider series crossing over to team up against a common foe.</p>
