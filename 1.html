    <h2>Showa Rider</h2>
    <p>Produced by Toru Hirayama and designed by Shotaro Ishinomori, Kamen Rider premiered on April 3,1971 intially intended as an adaptation of Ishinomori's Skull Man.</p>
    <p>After a four-year hiatus following the finale of Kamen Rider Stronger, the series returned to broadcast television in October 1979 for two years with The New Kamen Rider (featuring Skyrider) and Kamen Rider Super-1. In these shows, Tachibana was replaced by a similar character named Genjiro Tani (谷 源次郎, Tani Genjirō). The annual new shows ended briefly during the 1980s, punctuated by the 1984 Kamen Rider ZX special Birth of the 10th! Kamen Riders All Together!! (Hirayama's last project for the franchise).</p>
